# FEUQ: Effing Epic Unicorn Quest

The best damn MMO ever made, via Ruby, Sinatra, and Shoes.

## Running ffeuq

### The server

The server lives inside the '/server' directory. To run it, make sure you have the bundler gem installed, then 'bundle install' to get the rest.

Once you have that, just 'rackup config.ru', and your server will be running.

### The client

You're gonna need [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com). Once you've got that, run Shoes, choose "open application", and pick the "client.rb" file. Make sure you have the server running!
